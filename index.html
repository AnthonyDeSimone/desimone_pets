<h2>Leela</h2>
<p>
<h3>Food</h3>
Wet food in fridge and cabinet to the left of fridge. Dry food in tan/red bin.

<h3>Feeding</h3>
AM & PM: 1 cup of kibble, roughly a quarter of a cup of wet food (somewhere around there - I've never measures), and
enough water to mix it all together.

<h2>Midnight</h2>
<p>
He's the older, skinner black one.
<h3>Food</h3>
Wet food in fridge and cabinet to the left of fridge. Meds on top of microwave.
<h3>Feeding</h3>
AM & PM: About a fifth of a can of wet food along with his powdered medicine. I realized that pill organizer doesn't work so well for powder so I used the tiny knife to scrape it out. You can feed him in the bathroom. He's easy to pick up and put in there so no one else follows him in.
